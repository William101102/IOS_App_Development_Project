## Description

In the IOS App Development Project, I use the Xcode, UIKit and SwiftUI, ARKit, CoreML and CoreData to build 15 apps. Design App using wireframe, mockup and prototype my app idea, also create apps that use Machine Learning using Appleâ€™s new CoreML

## Technology

Project is built with:

  * Xcode
  * UIKit and SwiftUI
  * ARKit
  * CoreML and CoreData

## Project Description

 * ##### [I am Rich Project]:
App Function:
showcases a simple screen with a luxurious gem, symbolizing opulence, accompanied by a brief caption

Knowledge:
Using the MainBoMainStoryBoardard in Xcode to add Label and Image View. In the assect adding App Icon and Image, so I can select these two image in the MainStoryBoard to show in the App. In the Label can appear the text I want to show in the App.
   
 * ##### [I am Poor Project]:
App Function:
displays a minimalistic image of a bag of money on the screen, symbolizing simplicity

Knowledge:
Using the MainBoMainStoryBoardard in Xcode to add Label and Image View. In the assect adding App Icon and Image, so I can select these two image in the MainStoryBoard to show in the App. In the Label can appear the text I want to show in the App.

 * ##### [Dicee Project]:
App Function:
generates random dice rolls upon user interaction, simulating the act of rolling physical dice and providing a virtual solution for chance-based outcomes.

Knowledge:
I establish behavior-driven functionality, and link Interface Builder elements using IBActions and IBOutlets. With a focus on Swift constants, variables, and arrays, I craft a dice roller activated by both button press and phone shake.
  
 * ##### [Magic 8 Ball Project]:
App Function:
The Magic 8 Ball app provides instant responses to questions by simulating the shaking of the iconic toy, offering a touch of whimsical guidance through a blend of user interaction and random selection.

Knowledge:
I establish behavior-driven functionality, and link Interface Builder elements using IBActions and IBOutlets. With a focus on Swift constants, variables, and arrays, I craft a dice roller activated by both button press and phone shake.

 * ##### [Calculator Layout Project]:
App Function: 
The primary objective of this module is to utilize Auto Layout to ensure consistent and visually appealing display of UI elements in the Calculator app across various screen sizes and orientations, enabling seamless adjustment and alignment for optimal user experience.

Knowledge:
In this module, I'll master Auto Layout's constraints, alignment, and container techniques, empowering me to create a visually polished Calculator app that seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes and orientations, while also honing my ability to troubleshoot layout issues and leverage Stack Views for intricate interfaces.

 * ##### [Xylophone Project]:
App Function:
I creating a colorful XyloPhone app using the AVFoundation library, while honing my problem-solving skills through independent exploration of resources like Stack Overflow and Apple Documentation.

Knowledge:
I utilized my understanding of sound playback with AVFoundation, applied Swift programming concepts including functions, data types, loops, error handling, and ViewController lifecycle, while refining my problem-solving skills through effective utilization of resources like StackOverflow and Apple Documentation.
 
 * ##### [Eggtimer Project]:
App Function:
This module enhanced my problem-solving skills by combining online research with new Swift programming concepts to create an egg timer app, offering personalized egg boiling durations.

Knowledge:
I mastered problem-solving through online research and explored new Swift programming concepts, culminating in the creation of an elegant egg timer app customized for precise egg boiling preferences, while acquiring skills in Swift dictionaries, Timer API, conditional statements, functions with outputs, and ProgressView usage.
   
 * ##### [Quizzler Project]:
App Function:
I advance my app development journey by learning the essential Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern while creating a trivia quiz app, a popular educational application genre on the App Store.

Knowledge:
I advanced in app development by mastering the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern, creating a trivia quiz app, and gaining expertise in Swift Structures, Classes, UI manipulation, and code organization.

 * ##### [Destini Project]:
App Function:
The app allows users to embark on an interactive "choose your own adventure" journey, immersing them in a captivating story that unfolds based on their decisions, all while showcasing the implementation of the MVC design pattern and utilizing Swift Structures for effective separation of the Model and Controller.

Knowledge:
I advanced in app development by mastering the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern, creating a trivia quiz app, and gaining expertise in Swift Structures, Classes, UI manipulation, and code organization.

 * ##### [BMI Calculator Project]:
App Function:
The app calculates the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) using input data of weight and height, offering health advice based on the results, while also exemplifying Optionals, the MVC design pattern, and the differentiation between Classes and Structs.

Knowledge:
This module enabled me to employ Optionals, strengthen my grasp of the MVC design pattern, introduce Classes, and develop a Body Mass Index calculator app that offers health advice based on user input, incorporating skills in multi-screen app creation, optional handling, class implementation, pass by value/reference, String formatting, and UI enhancement through color literals.
