## Description

In the IOS App Development Project, I use the Xcode, UIKit and SwiftUI, ARKit, CoreML and CoreData to build 15 apps. Design App using wireframe, mockup and prototype my app idea, also create apps that use Machine Learning using Appleâ€™s new CoreML

## Technology

Project is built with:

  * Xcode
  * UIKit and SwiftUI
  * ARKit
  * CoreML and CoreData

## Project Description

 * ##### [Java Swing]: The graphical user interface (GUI) components and window management are handled using Java Swing.
 * ##### [Threads]: The game loop is run in a separate thread using the Runnable interface and Thread class to ensure smooth and responsive gameplay.
 * ##### [Graphics]: Graphics objects are used to draw the game elements (paddles, ball, scores, centerline) on the game panel.
 * ##### [Keyboard Input]: The game captures keyboard input using the KeyListener interface to control the paddles.
 * ##### [Randomization]: The Random class is used to initialize the ball's direction randomly at the start of the game.
 * ##### [Collision Detection]: The game uses collision detection algorithms to determine if the ball collides with the paddles or window edges.
